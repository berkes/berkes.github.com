I am Bèr Kessels, a freelance **webdeveloper**, I focus on development
and marketing of **cutting edge websites and applications**, with **Open
Source** technology. I live in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and work from
my office or at my clients place.

My handle on most networks is **berkes**.

My broad interest allows me to take many different factors, different
users, and various stakeholders into account when developing a project.
It also enables me to give lead to various teams, or to work within such
teams. My huge passion for Open Source, makes that I am well known to
the newest, cutting edge, technologies, systems and tools out there. And
that I can estimate when such technologies can be used most effectively.

With over 14 years of webdevelopment-experience, in various projects,
ranging from enormous applications at large enterprise- and media
corporations, to small blogs for family and friends, I can estimate
projects and their risks very well. 
This experience, together with a large array of (self built) tools and
methodologies, make me an efficient developer.

I mostly work with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). A
professional, Open Source platform which powers enormous (e.g.
Twitter.com) and tiny applications. With, obviously, a very large and
knowledgeable community behind it. But I also have a lot of experience
with alternative tools and systems, which make me a good candidate to
help find or apply the best technology for _your_ project.

My passion for technology extends to presentations as well. I have
presented on many conferences and meetings, for large and small
audiences. As workshop, lecture or even training. If you are looking for
speakers, please don't hesitate to ask me, I'd love to present about
cool technology.
