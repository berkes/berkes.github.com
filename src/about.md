I am Bèr Kessels, a freelance **software developer**, I focus on development
and marketing of **cutting edge websites and applications**, with **Open
Source** technology.

My handle on most networks is **berkes**.

I currently write software to automate administration and streamline bookkeeping for small businesses.
Modern, opinionated and optimized.

My broad interest and decades of experience in software development, allows me
to take many factors, users, current and upcoming tech, and all stakeholders into
account when developing software. It also enables me to give lead to various
teams, or to work within such teams.

I have deep and practical experience with many languages, frameworks and
architectures, with old and new tools and systems. This allows me to select and
apply the best technology for _your_ project and needs.

My passion for technology extends to presentations as well. I have
presented on many conferences and meetings, for large and small
audiences. I am available to host presentations or workshops.
