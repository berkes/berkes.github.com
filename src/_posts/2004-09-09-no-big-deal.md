I once saw this cartoon in a Dutch newspaper. There were two people on it, walking down a street while talking about the new elections of the president of the world. then one said: "yes its all fine that there is an election for president of the world again, but too bad we have to leave it to the Americans, only". I am not saying that we would do it better, becuase [we dont!](http://vlaamsblok.be/index.shtml), but at least it would be a fairer election! If I were to choose our new world leader, I would certainly bend over some figures to see what its all about. Not what they SAY its all about, but what its REALLY about. The greens in the US have a quite nice summary, to show that most of it, is bloat. Democrats and Republicans [differ, but far too little](http://www.therealdifference.org/issues2.html).
