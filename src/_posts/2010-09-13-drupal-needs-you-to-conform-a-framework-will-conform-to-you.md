An answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3697789/why-use-symfony-not-drupal/3698456#3698456">stackoverflow</a> to the endless question "should I choose Drupal or Foo" gets the whole problem with many Drupalprojects in one sentence: 

<blockquote>
  Drupal needs you to conform, symfony will conform to you - choose whichever you want.
</blockquote>

I would refrase that as: 
<blockquote>
  Drupal needs you to conform, a framework will conform to you - choose whichever you want.
</blockquote>

Now, that would not be a big problem, if you have that freedom: the __freedom to conform__. But many projects (clients) have certain demands, or expectations. 

On those projects, you often cannot conform. And even if you can conform, you often should not conform; not every case is best served with The Drupal Way[tm]. 

Ask yourself these questions: 
 
 * Do I want to conform to The Drupal Way? 
 * Can I conform to The Way of The Drupal? 
 * Will my client allow us to conform to the Drupal Way?

If the answer to any of these is *yes*, the next step would be to find out, what That Drupal Way[tm] is; that Drupal Way often needs to be found out and described to in great detail. 

If the answer to any of these questions is *no, certainly not*, you might want to not use Drupal at all. Or, more correct, not use a CMS at all, but learn a real framework.
