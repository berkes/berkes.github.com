With all the whining, nagging, negativisms and couldbedonebetters, I almost forget to write about all that great stuff that happens to Drupal in the mean time. All the work that <a href="http://acko.net/">great</a> <a href="http://drupal.org/services/gerhard">people</a> <a href="http://www.drupal4hu.com/">put</a> into <a href="http://www.buytaert.net/">Drupal</a> Hell, I could go on marking ever single word in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm">Grimm bundle</a> with A-s, to adress all those great people, sorry to those whom I forgot, I did not forget you! :)

One of the recent jewels, builds on top of Gerhards great work on the revisions. (yes, Drupal has a real revision framework now!) is a just committted. A full restyling of the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/42072">revisions overview</a>. Thanks a lot, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/12932">people</a> for <a href="http://www.quillem.com/">making</a> this all possible.<!--break-->
