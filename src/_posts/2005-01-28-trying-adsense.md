I just added a small adsense banner to the top. The reason is not that i need money, the reason is, that I need some statsistics on adsense. We are working on a concept, that will use [google ads](https://google.com/adsense/), but before that wee need some idea on adsense revenue. I need to know about CPM ratings, average click-per-hit rate etc. So feel free to click on the ads, if you think they are interesting. :)UPDATE: if ever i get paid for this, i.e. if i have earned over $100, i will [donate](http://drupal.org/node/2227) that money to Drupal.<!--break-->
