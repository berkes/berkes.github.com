The standalone browser [firefox ](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) was released last week. Of course I updatedan I must say that I am quite happy, untill today.<br /><br />I updated someones Windows installation of firefox, and it was much easier there, than on my linux box. <br /><br />Overall: the surfspeed is faster, pages load quicker and the browser runs more efficient and on a slow box this makes a lot of difference!<br /><br />However, the biggest problem I ran into on my local box is the fact that my mozffremote script did not work anymore. <br /><br />If you load a url, the script looks for an existing firefox window. and if found: it opens a new tab with the requested page in it using the [-remote options](http://mozilla.org/unix/remote.html) . This worked perfectly for me in firefox 0.8. But not 0.9.<br />Luckily the [ mozilla forums offered a solution.](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=87302&highlight=remote)So I ended up with a nice working little bash script:, that does all the magic.<pre>#! /bin/bash#if pgrep -u `id -un` "firefox-bin" > /dev/null ; then    if [ -z "$1" ]; then        /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox-0.8/firefox -a firefox -remote "xfeDoCommand (openBrowser)" &    else        /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox-0.8/firefox -a firefox -remote "openURL($1, new-tab)" &    fielse    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox-0.8/firefox $1fi</pre>
