Via [as it is](http://asitis.org/node/159), i came across a very [nice trick to make rounded corners](http://pro.html.it/esempio/nifty/), without any images. It uses Javascript and CSS only. It makes changing the colourscheme of a site very, very easy, since you only need to change text.**update: Steven, aka unconded has a much better version of [this trick online](http://www.acko.net/anti-aliased-nifty-corners)**
