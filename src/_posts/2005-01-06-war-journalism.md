I recently found [this weblog](http://www.67cshdocs.com/Daily_Journals/daily_journal_entries.htm). Its a blog by an army doctor in Iraq. Astonishing, disturbing, but above all [overwhelming](http://www.67cshdocs.com/Daily_Journals/December/dec21.htm) to read this diary. One must be really strong to be able to do this job. Its what we call "dweilen met de kraan open", "mopping with the tap opened". I do not agree with the whole war, but we (yes, I consider myself to be involved in some way) are in the middle of it. Quitting now would be worse, and finishing the job is hard. But people like this army doc will tip the balance to a positive, stable and human Iraq.
