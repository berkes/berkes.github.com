This morning Drupal announced its <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/10094">freeze for the 4.5 release</a>,. Since we, at nymfaeum, were working with the unreleased alpha version, this was a great time for one of the last updates.
All mayor issues were removed, so nymfeum runs on stable code as of today. If no real big annoyances pop up before the release of drupal 4.5, that moment will be the moment of the last upgrade. So in abour 1 and a half months nymfaeaum should be up and running!
