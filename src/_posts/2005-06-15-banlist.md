Since june 2005 <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> features a <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewcvs/drupal/drupal/modules/user.module?rev=1.479&view=log">method</a> to ban certain IPs. Mainly meant for banning ugly spiders, like AskJeeves, but also very hand for banning spam harvesters. This page contains a <a href="/sites/webschuur.com/files/spam_list.log">list of IPs I ban on this server</a>. I recollect these every now and then, from spam.modules database, from the logs and from various online resources. Feel free to post any additions in comments, but please add a resource about that IP. 

An auto-generated list from the spam module can be <a href="/sites/webschuur.com/files/spam_list.log">dowloaded here</a>. But be carefull with using that list, for spammers will often use false or hacked IPs.

The cron for generating such a list looks somthing like this.
<code>
echo "SELECT c.hostname FROM spam_comments s, comments c WHERE s.cid = c.cid AND s.spam = 1 AND s.rating > 95 group by c.hostname;" | mysql -u xxx -D xxx | sudo tee /xxx/files/spam_list.log
</code>
