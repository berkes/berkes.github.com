I just modified, configured and installed the [Stammy RSS to Twitter script](http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/01/26/stammy-script-rss-to-twitter-using-php/).

It will tweet new [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org) frontpage posts into the [Drupal twitter home](http://twitter.com/drupal) every 33 minutes (I like the number 33), if it all works, that is.

Just as everyone else, [I am experimenting](http://twitter.com/berkes) with ways to use Twitter. Feel free to post me any other ideas you have for the Drupal Twitters, I am interested in this new use of the web.
