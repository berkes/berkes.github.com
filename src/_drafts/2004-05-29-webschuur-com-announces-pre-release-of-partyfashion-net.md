<a href="http://www.partyfashion.net"><img class="node-image" width="200" height="255" src="/files/images/partyfashion.png" title="Partyfashion screensot" align="right" /></a>The Official release of <a href="http://www.partyfashion.net">partyfashion.net</a> is coming closer. Partyfashion.net is a community site in Drupal, meant as a case on how Drupal can handle social websites.<!--break-->

The project was still very alpha, until tonight. We used it to test a lot of ideas, and to test its structure. The layout is now finished, so the release is coming near.

We finished some workaround to avoid an annyoing Internet Explorer bug to break the layout. The bug caused IE to show the content always the full width of the screen, so that it covered all other content. 

Also the logo and header have been resized to allow banners and to make them fill the full width again.
