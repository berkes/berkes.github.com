My host moved his servers from the U.S. to Belgium last week, and I suffered some dataloss, not all too bad, but also some email.

So it might have been that mails send in the last two weeks never reached me. So If you sent me a mail, on <a href="mailto:ber@webschuur.com">ber@webschuur.com</a> I might have never received it. In that case I offer you my apologies and kindly ask you to re-send the mails!
