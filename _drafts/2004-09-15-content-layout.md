Before we can start adding content to thermal-elements.com, we have to define the structure of the content. This is still waiting in the to-do list and holding up other tasks.

A very good example can be found online <a href="http://www.remixreading.org/rfc/pages.html">for the remix reading project</a>.

This example shows much more, but gives a good idea about how things should look.

On thermal-elements we have three types of content: 
Articles
Products
Pages (general, for things like services, about us etc)
