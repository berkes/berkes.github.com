Unfortunately the first problem just hit me. I had the so called bakkers theme, that provided the look and feel for dot-o-dot.com.

The theme was build on top of xtemplate, in fact it was a heavt modified xtemplate theem. And fixing this to get it to work for drupal 4.5RC theme system is far too much work. I therefore chose to create a style on top of phptemplate. Tah way I can simply copy the style into the new system and propably create a new phptemplate style out of it, that contains some of the custom theme functions from bakkers theme. 
All in all it will take a little more time than estimated, but it will fix some issues in the process. Issues like mozilla not seeing the side-image properly, and the image shifting over the text in case of a small screen.
So all in all a little shifting of times will solve this issue without delaying or increaing the project time.
