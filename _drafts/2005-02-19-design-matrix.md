The design concepts are placed in an external Matrix. 
This matrix shows nine possibilities, arranged per types and arrangement of elelements. It is meant as reference to what is possible. Elements or types can or should be re-arranged according to ones exact wishes.

Please note that only one colour scheme was used, a blueish one. Off course we will apply a custom colour scheme.
