Drupal offers great abilities to virtually host multiple sites, it does this with a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/274" title="read more about multiple sites Drupal">unique technology in the config files</a>.

For thermal-elements I chose to use this approach to support both the domains thermal-elements.nl and thermal-elements.com. The latter (.com) will be leading, but for the user the .nl will have exactly the same level, content and useability.

On top of that, I plan to put two 403 permanently moved pointers on the old dot-odot domains, to catch any old indexes, spiders and referers.
