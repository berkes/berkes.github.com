This is a first attempt to create a nice widget or wizard for Drupal form building, using form API. It is useful in quanata, or any other application that can run kommander forms. Basically, it just runs a kommander script and parses the values in a string, that is then outputted. That string is a form.### Todo's
Add an insert and close buttonToggle the status of options (show only for elements that have options)Add much more fieldsToggle them too.[<span class="image thumbnail">![Screenshot of Form API kommander](http://www.webschuur.com/sites/webschuur.com/files/images/formapi_kommander.thumbnail.png "Screenshot of Form API kommander")</span>](/node/250)<br class="clear" />
