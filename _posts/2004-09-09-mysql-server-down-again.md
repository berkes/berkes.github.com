Last night our ibiblio MySQL server was down. I have a stron feeling that thios was due to our strange mysql but in the forums. The odd thing is that I tried to log into teh database, but found nothing there: no corrupted tables, nor anything else. 
Next thing I should do, is remove the forum things and start with a clean forum, but that is quite hard, because the forums cannot be cleaned from the web, because of that bug.

I am not sure what causes that erre, but I have a stron feeling it is due to a failed insert in the database on the exact moment a forum entry was created. It is not a known but, nor has anyone ever seen that error on any of their own installations.
