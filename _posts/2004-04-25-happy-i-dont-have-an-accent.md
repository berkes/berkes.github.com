[A Dutch article](http://www.nieuws.nl/news/NEWS/article.php?cat_id=4&article_id=23420) about an even stranger thing that happened. In short it tells that two people were beaten up and had to be taken to hospital, because they had a strange Dutch accent. Made me wonder what my Limburgs (Between German and Dutch) mixed with Hollands (Amsterdam) in a place where they speak Flemish (Antwerp) will cause. Would they have killed me?
