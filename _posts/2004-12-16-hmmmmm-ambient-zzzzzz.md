The nice thing about creative commons music, is the discovery part. Its lovely to be able to "discover" artists, simply by googling, or searching for keywords. You wont find Britney, nor Radiohead, but you might run into the ['autres directions in music'](http://autresdirections.net/inmusic/index.html) net label. And then you might have discovered the great ambient album [moulin007](http://autresdirections.net/inmusic/moulin007/moulin007.html). Yummie. I have not been so at ease while working since "the orb" :)
