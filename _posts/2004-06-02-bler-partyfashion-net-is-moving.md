Since the idea of webschuur is that it is a meeting point for various project relations, such as developers, clients and colleagues, we are moving to a networked system.

The first step is that all people who are somehow related can get a subdomain on this site for weblogging and sharing notes, ideas and photos.

To start with: I am moving my weblog <a href="http://bler.partyfsahion.net">Bl&egrave;r</a> to webschuur.com. <a href="http://bler.webschuur.com">bler.webschuur.com</a> will become the new address.
