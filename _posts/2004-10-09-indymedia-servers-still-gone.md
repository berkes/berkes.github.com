[The FBI issued an order to Rackspace](http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi) in the US (Indymedia's provider with offices in the US and London) to [remove physically one of their servers](/our). The order was so short term that Rackspace had to give away our hard drives in the UK. Amongst others, my dearest and beloveth [Antwerp IM is down](http://antwerpen.indymedia.org/).This is starting to stink more and more, if you ask me. No-one seems to be able [to say why](http://thewhir.com/marketwatch/aut100804.cfm). Why are servers taken away (and not just a single article)? Why does the FBI seize serves in the UK?
