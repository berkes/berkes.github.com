[Erik](http://drupal.org/user/73854) and [I (BÃ¨r Kessels)](http://drupal.org/user/2663) decided in December last year, that the Netherlands needed a Drupal trainingshop. And that we are going to run it: [Wizzlern](http://wizzlern.nl). We are not the first Dutch trainers, bytheway; our friends at Krimson run the [first Dutch trainingshop](http://krimson.be/en/training). But they are situated in Belgium, and we in the Netherlands. Right now, we are in the middle of a grand writing-sprint. Getting all the training-material ready, getting a nice branding (logo), installing and configuring an e-learning platform, and getting the word out in the open about our new Drupal initiative. A lot more work then one would think:I am writing two modules (from scratch), building and designing two entirely new themes (one on phptemplate, the other in pure PHP) and generating several screencasts. Since all the work is in Dutch, it makes little sense to release all this work as-is, it needs the context of a training to be valuable.

Still, one of our goals is to release (parts of) the work under GPL, and/or Creative Commons. And since our goal is to make the training pragmatic, these modules will be released soon too. They are actually usefull on a real site! As said, it is all going to be in Dutch, but we can always make the glove fit :). Translating our training-material to Englisch should not be too hard, if there is demand for it...

However, what I am most interested in, is finding a way to get this training-stuff out and open in an Open Source Way. Not by simply giving away the presentations, or the books or videos, but by collboration. Are there any (multiligual) projects that work communitywise on training-stuff for IT-related subjects? And could, we, Drupaleers learn from that, in order to get high quality material out there, and leverage Drupal as a whole?
