Putting google to yet another test.  So whats so interesting about it that it makes it into this blog? Because this is no test where Google is tested against other search-engines, but [google is tested against two other methods](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,1210455,00.html): the phone and the old fashioned library. Yea, thats that building where theye have those bundled papers stocked. You know biooks, the things that you can read in bed. (unbless, off course you cuddle up next to your laptop when you cant keep your eyes open anymore).
