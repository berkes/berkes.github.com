Once you are virtually the only one providing software, you come to stand before very difficault issues, it seems.

According to a news article on the Dutch newssite [WebWereld](http://www.webwereld.nl/nav/trillian?18483) Microsoft chose to release its servicepack for every OS, including illegal versions. Now one thing is for sure: Microsoft does not like illegal software. So it is safe to assume that Microsoft will not give a damn about illegal versions of their OS going down because of virussus. So this makes me wonder if they fear some big attack. One that might make more and more people wonder if there is no safer alternative. One that might even be [cheaper, cleaner and better adminstratable](http://www.linux.org) or [maybe easyier, and much more powerfull](http://www.mac.com).
