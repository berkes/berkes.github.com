  This is a summarised and ordered version of the thread on drupal.org "battle plans".<!--break-->        - Usability improvements [Dries, Chris Johnson]              
 - Change all browser-visible references to "node" to        something that might make sense to someone who is not a        computer geek. [Chris Johnson]        
 - Create a node zero feature that allows to create a        custom node to be displayed to someone who visits and has        no other access at all. [Chris Johnson]

    - Core (modules)
    - Theme system improvements. [MegaGrunt, adrian]
    - apart from my phptemplate based theme for 4.4.0 , i want to    enable drupal to use generic templating engines (ex: smarty,    xtemplate, php templates and phptal) without any problem, as    well as syndication of themes/templates using the install    subsystem. [adrian]
