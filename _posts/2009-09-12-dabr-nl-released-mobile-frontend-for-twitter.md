[Dabr.nl](http://dabr.nl) is released! Dabr is an [Open Source](http://code.google.com/p/dabr/) mobile frontend to twitter. It is better then m.twitter.com, self-hosted, and it is open source![David Carrington](http://davidcarrington.co.uk/) invented and built it. I merely installed and configured it for my Dutch servers. So to become a Dutch mirror for dabr!More about [Dabr.nl on the about page](http://dabr.nl/).

My reason for releasing and installing it, is that I believe in distribution. I believe the Power of the (Democracy of) internet lies in not depending on a single point of failure. I believe we should keep matters in our own hands (whenever and whoever can) and therefore run our own twitters. In due time, I plan integration with [status.net, the true distributed Twitter](http://status.net/).
