Together with [Morten](http://morten.dk/), one of the best Drupal themers, I will give an introduction in Theming for Drupal-6. So, if you aer interested in theming for Drupal in general, or Drupal6 in specifics, make sure you pop in at the Drupal-developers room.[![I'm going to FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting](http://www.fosdem.org/promo/going-to)](http://www.fosdem.org)
