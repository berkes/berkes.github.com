Het zier ernaar uit dat Google dus echt met jabber 'aan de wandel gaat'. Ditzou wel eens de grootste gebeurtenis kunnen blijken in IM-land.[via walkah: talk.google.com](http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/talk-google-com)WOW! so, [it's true](http://thousandrobots.com/blog/archives/2005/08/using_googles_n.php)! there have been various rumblings [around](http://gigaom.com/2005/08/22/here-comes-google-voice/) the [web](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/23/1313229&tid=217), but I just in fact was able to log on to talk.google.com using my gmail account info via [adium](http://www.adiumx.com "Adiumx - OSX IM client").what am i talking about? well, for those of you who don't know, the [jabber project](http://www.jabber.org/) has been around for several years offering an *open* protocol for instant messaging (amongst other things). i've followed the project for quite a few years now - pretty sure that it was something special. not to take anything away from apple - who's [ichat av](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/) supports jabber natively as of tiger - but i have a feeling that google's adoption may well be the biggest thing to happen for "consumer jabber". the best part (from my early stance) is that it's actually open, "true" jabber, i can connect with my standard drupal client - no vendor lock-in (although we can presume that google will distribute their own client, no?)</pit's all coming at a pretty interesting time since i've been doing a fair bit of tinkering with jabber again lately (yes, it involved [drupal](http://drupal.org "drupal content management platform") and [yes, boris](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1538) i will release it real soon now). what's more, while in Portland (for OSCON) i actually got to meet two of the "big names" from the jabber foundation (namely [peter saint-andre](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/) and [dave "dizzyd" smith](http://dizzyd.com/blog/)) who were interested in drupal albeit for other reasons, hopefully more on that later.
looks like these "open standards", "free software" folks might be on to something...**UPDATE:** and [the google talk site](http://www.google.com/talk/) is now live. very cool
