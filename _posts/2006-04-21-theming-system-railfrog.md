Codename kiss. (Because a kiss turns the frog into a prince.)To develop a theme system for Railfrog, we need to look at other systems, reuse existing libraries, but most of all, DoI It Right and Futureproof.

Themes must be easy to develop for designers, powerful to use for overriding defaults, and most of all it must look gorgeaus and be very accessible. The engine, or theme system, should at the very least allow this beauty and accessibilty, but if possible, should make developing such themes simple!See the attached PDF for the full proposal.
