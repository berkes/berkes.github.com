I found a really nice tracking system, dedicated for feature request: [FeVote](http://www.fevote.com). Since I'd like to try if it actually works as one would expect, I removed the ability to request features, on [Tagadelics](http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic) issuetracker. openend a project for it on FeVote. So: if you have requests for tagadelic, log in (openID) or register [over there](http://www.fevote.com/tagadelic) and add your request, or vote for existing ones. If it works, then I think I will use it for more (Drupal related) projects. The downside, I guess, is that people will start to expect a certain feature to appear, once it gains enough votes; which, obviously, may not happen. After all: development is not a democratic process. The upside is that I can gain insight into what people miss. Often one finds that very simple changes, make gazillion people happy; while large changes only appeal to the creator of that change.
