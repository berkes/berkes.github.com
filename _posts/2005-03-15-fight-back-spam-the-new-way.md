<b>from [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/15/0035225&from=rss)</b><br />[Philipp Lenssen](http://blog.outer-court.com) writes <i>"The blogger community is [fighting back](http://www.threadwatch.org/node/1882), though in ways not everyone may like: they are Googlebombing the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker) on online poker for the phrase "[online poker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker)" to make it rank higher in search engines. "[Online poker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker)", along with "[Viagra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viagra)", "[mortgage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mortgage)" and "[debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debt)", are keywords heavily represented in comment spam, which itself aims to boost the Google ranking for a particular site and phrase. The Wikipedia page is currently [third in Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=online+poker)."</i>
