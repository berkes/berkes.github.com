While I write this, my first <a href="http://linode.com">linode.com VPS</a> is booting up. Well, not my fist, but the first linode I work on.
Tim bates opened an account at linode, because I adviced him to have a look at how a dedicated host would aid his ideas of a virtual site Drupal platform (a <a href="">Drupal news site for all</a>). But a dedicated host is by far too expensive to just go and play with. So Testing if your ideas are correct is best done on a VPS.
And after experiencing a LOT of bad things with Lycos (webschuur is there :() I adviced him to look at linode.

My first impression is great: Excellence in simplicity. It all works [TM] I just simply changed from centos to debian, which is just a personql preference, and it all works like a breeze. 
By now it is surely booted, so I can get back to work. Soon more on the actual stability and scalability of linode.com.
