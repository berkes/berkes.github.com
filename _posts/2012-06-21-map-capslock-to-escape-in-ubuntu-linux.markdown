If you are a Vim user, you probably want the [escape key more at hand](http://federico.galassi.net/2012/06/20/the-vim-holy-grail/). On Ubuntu (And probably every Gnome3 desktop) this is really very easy. It comes with point-and-click tools to map your key to about everything you can think of; and more. If you google this problem, you find all sorts of xmonad CLI commands. They work too, but this is far easier for the stupid Linux-user like me.

1. Open `System settings`.
1. Click `Keyboard Layout`.

1. Click `Options`.

1. Under `Capslock`, choose whatever you want.

I chose `switch Escape and Capslock`. So that if I REALLY WANT TO SHOUT AT PEOPLE I STILL CAN! :).
And it forces me to relearn the escape key.
