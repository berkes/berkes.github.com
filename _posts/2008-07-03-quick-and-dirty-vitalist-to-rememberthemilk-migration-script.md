Because I decided to try [Remember the milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com) again for my Getting Things Done thingies, I had to import all my stuff from [vitalist.com](http://vitalist.com). In order to do so, I hacked together a [dirty Ruby script](http://snipplr.com/view/7104/rough-vitalist-to-rememberthemilk-conversion/). It may help someone who  is trying to achieve the same.So, Why do I want to move from Vitalist? Well, Remember the milk has much better accessability, using Google Gears (offline work, when travelling, I can still access my lists), SMS, much better calendar integration, A lot nicer and better APIs and so forth and so forth. The best is, however, that Rememberthemilk is not crippled if you don't pay. Vitalist is. They minimised the free version so much, that it is hardly usable once you get going on this GTD stuff.Not htat I mind paying. I love paying, if that paysthe rent of the folks providing a great service, bunt in that case, in case I pay, I would like the service to improve.I haven't seen Vitalist improve a lot lately. Sure, they added an iPhone version. But I don't have one, and iPhone. Soo, sum these two up, and Rememberthemilk makes a free, feature loaden, fast-evolving service. Compared to a payed, hardly improving, yet very well focused service, Vitalist. Maybe, after using rememberthemilk for a while, I will decide to write a RTM to vitalist Ruby script. We'll see.
