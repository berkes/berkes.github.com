While changing the settings for another domain, I accidentaly changed a file permission on the server for webschuur.com. My fallback and backup system caused it to revert to the latest known stable release. Because that fallback worked rather well, it took me two days to notice it. Sorry for all th folks getting 404s and access denieds. Stuff is back up and running again now.
