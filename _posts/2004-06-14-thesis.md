w0000t. I defended my thesis today. And yes: I passed it.

My thesis was about fuelcells, a propande fuelcell system, to be precice. My total point was an eight (of ten), but I had some very low points: organisation a three, and presentation material a four. But.... The content and technical part of my thesis got a ten! that is a poerfect.

So now the time has come to study on these organisational parts.
