Of course not ;). Or maybe sometimes, [a little bit (Dutch)](http://www.webwereld.nl/nav/trillian?18487). In the Netherlands people can test their political preference by filling out [a web-test](http://www.stemwijzer.nl). Just before last elections this was one of the Netherlands most visited sites. The re-launch took place with a lot of media attention. Not only because of the popularity of the site, but because some no.1 candidates dit the test. LAst elections some no1 candidates dit this too, but shame! Some ended on another party! They were advised to vote for another party than the one they were a candidate for. So this year three parties made sure this would not happen again and got hold of a list with the questions, so that they could rehearse them. Unfortunately one of the candidates did not like this and [placed it on his site. (this had to be taken offline, but there is a mirror)](http://blokje.free.fr/berman/).

Shame on you [parties](http://www.pvda.nl), shame [on you](http://www.cda.nl)!
