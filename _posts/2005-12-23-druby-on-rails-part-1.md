So, please don't get me wrong (it appears to quite some people <em>did</em> get me wrong) 

<ul>
  <li>I never intended to make a drupal in RoR.</li>
  <li>I never intended to make a drupal that is a RoR clone</li>
  <li>I do not have plans for any of these</li>
  <li>I never want to say one is better then the other. They are different. I cannot yet speak for RoR, but nothing is perfect. Drupal is not perfect. Druby on rails just binds some ideas I have about Drupal. How to make it closer to perfect.</li>
</ul>

However, I <em>do</em> have plans for (or actually, working on it already) for a distro that:

<ul>
  <li>Is developer friendly. Developer centric</li>
  <li>Allows developers to make it fully end-userfriendly with minimal efforts</li>
  <li>Has some good ideas from RoR built in</li>
</ul>

That is all!
