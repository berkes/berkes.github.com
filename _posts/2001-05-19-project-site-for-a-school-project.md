During a school project in 2001, we decided to share all the resources. I created a small and simple static site for that on our yahoo project pages. <a href="/portfoliofiles/aandrijven/index.html">Follow this link to the example</a><!--break-->

Note that most of the resoures were taken offline, so all external links will not work. Also the full previews of the photos are not included.
