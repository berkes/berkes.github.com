We are protesting against attempts to legalise software patents in Europe.

For ASF developers and users alike, this directive would mean legal uncertainty:a patent minefield. With the current flood of [trivialpatents](http://webshop.ffii.org/) legalised, software innovation would become a dangerous enterprise in Europe.

The Council of Ministers is pushing for unlimited patentability of software,heavily lobbied by patent lawyers.  Don't let them ignore the[EuropeanParliament's democratic decision](http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=CALDOC&FILE=20030924&LANGUE=EN&TPV=DEF&LASTCHAP=31&SDOCTA=2&TXTLST=2&Type_Doc=ANNEX&POS=1) of 24th September 2003. The parliament's decisionto limit software patentability has the support of more than [300.000 citizens](http://petition.eurolinux.org/), [2.000.000SMEs](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/ceapme0309/index.en.html) and dozens of [economists](http://www.researchineurope.org/policy/patentdirltr.htm) and [scientists](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/komp0305/index.en.html).
