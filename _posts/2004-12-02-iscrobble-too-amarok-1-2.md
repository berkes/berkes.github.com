[walkah](http://walkah.net/node/120 "audioscrobbler | walkah") asked me I if Scrobbled. _do you scrobble? i do. i'm completely addicted. this is "social networking" in a way that i can really appreciate._The answer to his question was "no s√©", since I am highly addicted to [amarok](http://amarok.kde.org). But amarok now released 1.2 beta-1. and guess what? It contains [audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/bler/)!Amarok 1.2 looks beutifull, it even supports MySQ. My music database, all the musical relations, my rating data, the covers, etc, etc, all live in a MySQL database. But best of all, it supports audioscrobbler. If only audioscrobbler were not down at the exact moment I join em, life would be great.
