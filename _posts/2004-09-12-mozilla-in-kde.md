Yay! Of course it has always been possible to run firefox on KDE, but not in it. [today KDE announced](http://dot.kde.org/1094924433/) that it has ported gecko (Mozilla) to QT. Which basically means that Mozilla (and firefox) will get the same look and feel as other kde applications! yay. It is not that I do not like konqueror, on contrary, but I prefer firefox for its speed and developer functionality.
