Finally I found the link to the [RSS feeds for Indymedia Belgium.](http://belgium.indymedia.org/newswire.rss) Both the Dutch and the Belgian sites don't show the links on their homepage, but newsisfree brought me to the correct url, for Belgium. The one for netherlands is still hidden for me, if they have one at all.
