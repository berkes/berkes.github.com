Shirts are always cool. esp those who bear logo's that only few recognise. I own a shirt with [tigra]() on it. Great when someone recognises you.> Hheeeeuuu (pointing at my shirt)Cool man! Gutsman. I am fan too.

And now i found a cool shirt thats a [spinn-off](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66209,00.html) of a highly debates quote by Bill Gates. King Gates called Creative commoners, or GNU people Communists. Well, you guessed it right, some [cool logos were created](http://home.nc.rr.com/frijole//copyleft/) And made it onto [t-shirts](http://www.giantrobotprinting.com/commies/)<!--break--> (cafepress has [some](http://www.cafepress.com/creativecommies) too)** UPDATE: I am now a happy owner of the shirt. It wsas deleivered very fast, for very little money, and is of good quality. The only minor issue, is that I ordered size M, but thats a U.

S. Size, so I still feel like a nigga. ***
