Emerce, a high profile, professional Dutch magazine features a [story on the Drupal](http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws.jsp?id=1883229) association, in which they also introduce some core concepts of Drupal.  Emerce is primarily a printed magazine, but is shifting towards more we-based news lately.  The most interesting aabout this, is that a magazine such as [Emerce](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerce) is apparently aware of the things happening in he OSS world. And because of the authority of a magazine like this, bigger (more professional) businesses will notice projects such as Drupal, and consider them as a more serious option. Lets hope that in the Netherlands Drupal will take off too now.
