As of the first of may, I installed <a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">webalizer</a> on the webschuur servers, which host about ten sites. I did this, to get access to mored detailed statistics then Drupal can (and should) offer. 

However, last weeks log shows an interesting fact: visitors of my hosted sites mostly use firefox. 

On a total of 27117 hits, the ranking is as follows
1  39.35%  Mozilla/5.0
2  16.69%  MSIE 6.0
3  11.75%  Konqueror/3.4

The number three, ended up so high, only because it is the browser I use. and since i have been working a lot on my sites last week that shows the high ranking.
Off course the rather technical community in which i work, explains this, but still, (Mozilla) firefox being used by over double the amount of users with IE 6 surprises me.
