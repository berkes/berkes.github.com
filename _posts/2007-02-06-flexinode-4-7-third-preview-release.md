I just released the third release for 4.7 [flexinode](http://drupal.org/project/flexinode). This is a preview release, so I advice you not to run it on your production site yet. That said, I expect this release to already be far more stable then the 4.7 "release" we had earlier 2006. The main difference is that we no longer recursively search for fields. Another mayour milestone, is that all core./critical fields are now tested and included. Please [test it](http://drupal.org/node/116391), and provide feedback.
