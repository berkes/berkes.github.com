Alright. I admit.<br />Drupal search sucks.<br />But that does not mean mean that you should not try to at least look around on the forums.<br /><br />Since a few days #drupal-support irc channel is running on irc.freenode.net. A support channel, mainly meant to bounce the never ending silly questions on #drupal.<br /><br />As [drumm ](http://delocalizedham.com/) admitted he does not have time for this,<br /><pre>[00:26:46] - --Gebruiker drumm [~drumm@h-67-100-116-156.snvacaid.covad.net] neemt deel aan kanaal #drupal-support [00:29:48] &lt;drumm&gt;yep, there are people here [00:30:06] &lt;drumm&gt;realistically I won't have time for this [00:30:29] - --drumm heeft het gesprek verlaten ("need coffee and air conditioning...").</pre>And I am seriously doubting if I am ever willing to spend my time on this too.<br />I mean:<pre>[23:06:41] &lt;xxxxx&gt;does drupal support nice url's without the node number being in the url?</pre>NOw, Sorry! but you don't even need to search to find out if this is the case.....
