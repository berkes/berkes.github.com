I use browsercam and flickr for reports of website designs. 

All designers will know the hell you have to go trough when you design a site, and you see it on another platform and browser. The site will most probably look horrible. 

Because I develop on linux, and have no access to a windows machine with internet explorer (thank god, for that!), I use <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">browsercam</a> to generate screendumps from other browsers and platforms. 
I then import these into my <a href="http://flickr.com/">flikr</a> to annotate the picture. This can be used as a full blown report, sinceits public accessible (other in your team, and clients, can see what you think about errors) and its interactive and clear.
