I spent some time upgrading the software on the server today. For this, i found a nice reference <a href="http://www.bartendavid.be/doc/howto/install/misc/installdebianpackages.html">Bart en David</a>. It is a very nice <strong>Dutch</strong> manual about apt. Not only does it explain what its all about, fro, a novice point of view, its also usable as reference.
