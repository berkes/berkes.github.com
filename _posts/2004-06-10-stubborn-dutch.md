The Elections for the european parliament have started today with elections in the Netherlands and in the UK. The Dutch, however [ triggered quite some spat](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3792877.stm)  over the fact theat they are releasing the results tonight already. The results were actually not due to be announced until polling across the EU had ended. Sunday in we will see how my [favorites](http://www.eurogreens.org/) will do.
