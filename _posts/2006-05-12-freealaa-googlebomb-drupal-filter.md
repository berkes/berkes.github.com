This is my small addition to the bloggers rally against the arrest of Alaa. It is a small **Drupal filter** that will turn every occurence of Egypt into    _&lt;a href="http://freealaa.blogspot.com/"&gt; Egypt &lt;/a&gt;_[Grab it here](http://bler.webschuur.com/sites/bler.webschuur.com/files/alaa_egypt_filter.module.txt). Rename it to _alaa_egypt_filter.module_. And install it on your website. Note that you must enable the filter under "input" formats. Also note that this filter is only tested on a 4.6 website, but that it should also work on a 4.7.

More about this rally [Here](http://technorati.com/tag/googlebombingforalaa) and in Egypt.
