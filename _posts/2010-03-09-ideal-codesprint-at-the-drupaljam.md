I will be hosting a [Drupal iDEAL Codesprint ](http://drupaljam.nl/sessies/drupaljam-5-utrecht/ideal-codesprint) on the Drupaljam in Amsterdam. Please add a comment there, email me (ber -- webschuur - com) or contact me in whatever other way if you want to join, more information or anything else.> iDeal is a Dutch, online payment system, widly adopted, but hard to implement.&nbsp;In Drupal there are many iDeal implementations for übercart, but none are very solid and none are easy to implement; some are even plain insecure.&nbsp;We, the Dutch Drupal community should **focus development on one generic iDEAL layer**. A general iDEAL payment API. &nbsp;Then developers can build their small übercart-ideal-payment, ecommerce-ideal-payment or whatever-ideal modules on top of that.&nbsp;We do not just need code, **Documentation is just as important**. One of the hardest part is finding out how to get it running, configured and how to get all the parameters right. Differences in implementation of banks, or their payment-plans make it extremely complex to get running fast. &nbsp;If you have **no experience** with iDEAL, we will explain the basics here (only if you promise to help, it is not a free iDEAL-course :).&nbsp;If you have **code lying around** for iDEAL implementations, please bring it.&nbsp;iDeal is a Dutch, online payment system, widly adopted, but hard to implement.&nbsp;In Drupal there are many iDeal implementations for übercart, but none are very solid and none are easy to implement; some are even plain insecure.&nbsp;We, the Dutch Drupal community should **focus development on one generic iDEAL layer**.

 - Agree upon where to centralise our development
 - Investigate all available code and modules (bring your code too, please)
 - Document the generic API concept: mission statement and short introduction
 - Write (stubs of) howto's and help-texts
 - Distribute the code/development issues and todo's
Time of the sprint will follow. Sprint will be in English, unless there are no none-dutch speakers at all attending.&nbsp;For my initial work, refer to [the ideal-payment-api on Github](http://github.com/berkes/Drupal-iDeal-payment-api) (note the crappy documenation :).For some of the TODOs with _this_ api, see the [issue list](http://github.com/berkes/Drupal-iDeal-payment-api/issues)Note: It is not yet sure if we will take this one as our starting-point, or merely as one of the references and code-pieces.
