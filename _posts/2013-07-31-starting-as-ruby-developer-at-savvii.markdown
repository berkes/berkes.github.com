Monday (5th of Juli) I am starting at the startup [Savvii](http://savvii.nl). To
be part of the team that wants to bring you the very best WordPress
hosting in the Netherlands.

I am going to develop the software for the back end: program the robots that
do all the magic behind-the-scenes work.

Because I am a Ruby-developer, I'll do this in Ruby. We
needs some technical things like long-running threads and asynchronous
workers and stuff, which makes Ruby (and Rails) one of the best
candidates. I'll be blogging more about the technical stuff on our yet-to-go-online blog. And probably here too.

WordPress, for those who are not too much into this stuff, is the most used, of [the
three most popular CMSes](http://trends.builtwith.com/cms). It is the
software [behind many famous and popular
websites](http://en.wordpress.com/notable-users/) and is commonly known
as a Blogging-system, rather then a generic CMS.

## WAT!? You be doing WordPress-development?

Probably a little, but my task is
to get the back end-software running, which is building stuff like CRMs, billing gateways, provisioning APIs and whatnot.
My [fellow-programmer](https://twitter.com/fuegas) is the main PHP-and WordPress-developer. But I will certainly dive into WordPress now
and again to make it play nicely with all the Ruby back ends.

## But didn't you say you hate WordPress, Drupal and all that other PHP-stuff?

Nope. Apparently a lot of people seem to think that I am "against"
Drupal, WordPress or even PHP in general. On contrary: I like them a
lot. And very often advise people to use this software for their
websites.

I merely think that such CMSes have their place and cases, but are often abused
in cases (and projects) where they fit poorly: the right tool for the
job. Apparently many people read that as "haters gonna hate". I don't.
Hate.

## What about your own company?

I'll be putting my all my focus on Savvii, on making it
a great hoster. But I expect to go back to some small side-projects once we are
moving. Not sure how it will combine, but time will learn.
[Berk.es](http://berk.es/about.html) will continue to exist, albeit
dormant for a while.

## Savvii? WordPress hoster?

We are just starting, so all the details are still unclear.
But in short, translated from [the placeholder
website](http://savvii.nl):

> Savvii is the new managed WordPress platform for the Netherlands.
> That means speed (caching, CDNs, tweaks), security (scans, free fixes,
> automatic updates) and service!

Savvii is part of the family of companies around [bliXem
internet](http://www.blixem.nl), which is where I'll be working. Yes,
that is Nijmegen, so I can go to work on my bike.

I am really grateful to become part of such a good team and to be able
to get the opportunity to help such a promising startup going!
