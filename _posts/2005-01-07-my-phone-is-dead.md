Since a while my battery of my mobile-phone is really dead. The battery if flat withing no time. Luckily there seems to be a solution for that:[Personal Powerstation from I Want One Of Those](http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/WIN3MO_GADG.htm "Personal Powerstation from I Want One Of Those")Then I really can have the 'Power' wherever I am, without being a slave to the National Grid.
