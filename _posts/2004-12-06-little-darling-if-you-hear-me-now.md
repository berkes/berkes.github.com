 Sail away with me [honey](http://www.chiquechick.com) I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be will be I wanna hold you now Crazy skies all wild above me now Winter howling at my face And everything I held so dear Disappeared without a trace Oh all the times I've tasted love Never knew quite what I had Little Darling if you hear me now Never needed you so bad Spinning round inside my head  Sail away with me honey I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be will be I wanna hold you now  I've been talking drunken gibberish I've been puching at the bars Trying to find some explanation here For the way some people are How did it ever come so far  Sail away with me honey I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be will be I wanna hold you now Sail away with me honey I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be will be I wanna hold you now-- David Gray - Sail away on White ladders.
