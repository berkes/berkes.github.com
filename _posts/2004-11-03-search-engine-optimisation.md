For optimising your website for search engines, and also for investigation your search engine statistics, we suggest you use the <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/seo.html">SEO</a> bookmarklets. Those can be used with virtually all browsers.

A more robust solution is installing the developer toolbar in firefox. IT can be found <a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=60&vid=645">on the extensions pages</a>.
