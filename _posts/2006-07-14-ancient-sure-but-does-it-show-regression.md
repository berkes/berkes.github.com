![screenshot of 4.0?](http://webschuur.com/sites/webschuur.com/files/2062.png) While browsing Freshmeat (looking for a database structure visualiser) I thought "lets see [Drupal's entry](http://freshmeat.net/projects/drupal)".

The download urls and so, seem up to date, the description is somewhat crufty, but not outdated either. But the screenshot is an old (pre) 4.0 (I am not sure).

The most asonoshing thing, however, is to see the great usability of our old-and-forgotton admin area. About three-and-a-half(!) years ago, we used to have a separate <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewcvs/drupal/drupal/admin.php?view=log&only_with_tag=">admin area</a>. And the best of it all is that it looks very much more userfriendly then our current structure. Maybe it safe to state that some parts of Drupal actually regressed, amids all the great progression.
