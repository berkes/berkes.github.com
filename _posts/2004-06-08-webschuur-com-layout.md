I ran into the exact same bug that kept me so long from releasing partyfasnion.net. 
The bug is a known Internet Explorer bug. Internet explorer doen not follow certain CSS settings the way it should.

Thus all my pages were kind of scrambled in internet explorer. I quickly had to remove all the CSS that caused this, and am plannign to do some re-design work next week. But for now i have some clients waiting, so this design issue will have to wait.
