This morning I was a bit surprised to find a strange letter on the [Belgian indymedia](http://www.indymedia.be). It was letter by Michael Moore, the director of the famous documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11". The letter comes from his [own website](http://www.michaelmoore.com/), and seems to spread rapidly over the internet. Good! But the content of the letter is even more astonishing. Michael Moore decided to "not (to) submit "Fahrenheit 9/11" for consideration for the Best Documentary Oscar", because " If there is even the remotest of chances that I can get this film seen by a few million more Americans before election day, then that is more important to me than winning another documentary Oscar. I have already won a Best Documentary statue. Having a second one would be nice, but not as nice as getting this country back in the hands of the majority."That remote chance would be to show the documentary on TV, so that it would really reach the masses of US electors. It is said that the documentary has a great influence on those who have seen it, "a Keystone poll showed that 4% of Kerry's support has come from people who decided to vote for him AFTER seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11""The problem is, that a documentary is not allowed to be shown on television in the nine months before the Academy Awards. So even though the chance that it will be shown is small, he did not want to rule out that chance by submitting his documentary for those awards. A brave thing to do, for we all have our place in trying to get the world straight again, and those that are willing to put personal gain aside for their ideals are the only true revolutionists.
