Another one of those very "true" lyrics: "Air- How does it make you feel?, 10.000 Hz Legend" Mich, luister je mee?I am feeling very warm right nowPlease don't disappearI am spacing out with youYou are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed ofAt night I will protect you in your dreamsI will be your angelYou worry so much about not having enough time togetherIt makes no difference to meI would be happy with just one minute in your armsLet's have an extended play togetherYou're telling me that we live to far to love each otherBut your love can stretch further than you and I can seeSo how does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?Do you know when you look at meIt is a salvationI've been waiting for you so longI can drive on that road foreverI wish you could exist to live on my planetWell it's very hard for me to say these things in your presenceSo how does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?So how does it make you feel?Well,I really think you should quit smoking
