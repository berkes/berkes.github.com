Slowly but surely Lycos is restoring from some strange error (or was it a mistake) 
suddenly all Vhosts had no more space left on the hardrives. 
Webschuur.com servers, hosting all greensnet, dwars, chiquechic and off course webschuur.com sites is back. the other server, hosting newsphoto.nl is still "full" but it seems that that will be solved soon.
