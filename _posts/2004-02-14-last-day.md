After spending one of those nights where you only know the next day that the re was one beer too many, I had a horrible day.I had to admit to myself that the fact that it was actually my last day at work gave me some power, but not enought to get this boozy feeling in my head away. Knowing you have to leave always makes my skin tingle a little. For goodby's always mean new hello's.Leaving one place, automatically means arriving on another one. This fact gives me courage, but even better: it makes me nervous in a positive way when the moment is there. The tingly feeling in my belly arrived when the numb feeling in my head left: New Horizons. Now Get movinG, life is waiting.
