Yesterdaynight I installed the userposts.module on the remixrteading website. It allows us to see a <a href="http://ibiblio.org/remixreading/www/?q=user/2">summary of user contributed articles</a>, in the userprofile. Of course it needs some designing, to make the list come out better, and it needs some smal translation hacksih thing in order to change "flexinode-1s" into work entries or so. But because we do not have this information available (personal blog entry is available, personal blog entries not) I needed to fix this somehow. So I decided to do it the lazy way, and use locales for this.
