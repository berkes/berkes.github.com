DrupalCOM is a repackaging of the default drupal installation. 

<a href="/misc/drupaldotcom.tar.gz">Download it here</a><!--break-->

It is a repackaging optimised for so called "brochure sites", or the "digital leaflet". Those are sites aimed at awareness of a company, with sections as "feedback", "about us", our portfolio", "our products", etceteras . 

When you install this repackaged software, you will see that a lot of configuration options, categories, roles, permissions, blocks etc are pre-set. It uses todays CVS version of drupal, with some extra modules. It uses only flexinode for its content.

Feel free to download and try, but don't forget to give feedback, please.
