I am currently developing a new theme for a new site and I decided to blog the process once. The theme is called «[WhatsInItsName](/taxonomy/term/65)» and so is the "tag".
<!--break-->
There are a few requirements. The theme must:

 * be fully SEO supporting
 * be accessible on mobile devices
 * highlight the content, content comes first. 
 * be appealing to the eye. So it should look rather good. 

Furthermore, the client has some requests:

 * It should be easy to change the backgrounds, so that the client can re-use it on his network of sites.
 * It should be possible to bear several banners and logos. See above.
 * The design should show "boxed" content. Frames, drop shadows and rounded corners are appreciated. 

You see: quite some list, yet nothing extraordinary for a Drupal site. 

I think, no, I __know__, that any theming job should start with a short list of requirements and goals. Especially when you get Really Creative, you often loose the goals out of sight. Ending up with beautiful looking stuff, or really nifty CSS stuff, but forgetting about simple details as "content comes first", for example because you use too much white space, or graphical elements.

Therefore, I start this blog-series with the lists.

Now [lets get rolling](/taxonomy/term/65).
