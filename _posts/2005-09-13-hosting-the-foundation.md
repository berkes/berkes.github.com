For various projects, I am developing some small provisioning systems for drupal multisite environments.<!--break-->
I now want to merge all these ideas into one. It is meant to work on growth, start with what we have, and slowly add more and more automation. 
For now that suits quite well. I manage about fifteen sites, on seven domains (and thus eight subdomains) and it is still manageable. But it starts to crumble. Doing everything over email only, makes managing this a bit ad-hoc. 
And with <a href="http://www.lycos-vds.com/board/viewtopic.php?p=7998#7998">lycos having some performance issues</a> the server became very unstable. Resulting in the server being offline quiet a lot, MySQL crashing a lot. etc. This all needed to be improved and become more stable. But most of all more professional. So I <a href="http://www.newmoon.nl">and Pepijn</a> got together and made some plans. Big Plans. More about that, later, <a href="/taxonomy/term/36">in the 'Drupal Hosting' blog category</a>.
