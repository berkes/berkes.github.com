A new project is placed on the benchmarks in the webschuur.com, <a href="http://www.nymfaeum.nl">nymfaeum, a collaborative writing site</a>.<!--break-->

The cutting edge of this case is that I chose not to use drupal's built in node-types for all the content, but rather flexinode. Flexinode offers you much more power over the content. Flexinode together with a well designed taxonomy gives an adminstrator so much power that he will never use any other tool than <a href="http://www.drupal.org">drupal</a> anymore!

Currently our tools in the webschuur.com are still the big hammer and the big saw, but as time goes along and the site shapes more and more we will start using finer tools. 
For now the roough edges are forming. We see what we are talking about. We have felling where we want to go and what it should look like. <a href="http://www.newmoon.nl">Pip</a> is working in the webschuur too, you can <a href="/blog/2">read his</a> blog for more information on the process of this collaborative wrintg and community site.
