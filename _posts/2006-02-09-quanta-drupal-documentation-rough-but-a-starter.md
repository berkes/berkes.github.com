[Steven developed](http://www.acko.net/blog/textmate-drupal-bundle) a script for some mac application, so that it can do stuff with Drupal functions. I had some ugly small trials lying around to do the same for [Quanta](http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/). And since I cannot stand it (joking!) that mac guys get stuff done easier and faster then KDE, I took Stevens script and hacked it into a Quanta documentation generator. Well, its only halfway, the hardest part is still that we need to catch the doxygen and parse that into the function.funcname.html files. Oh, and my script also writes out an xml file so that all your Drupal PHP code in KDE has highlighted Drupal functions. At least, it should work, but I need to find a way to inherit all the default PHP stuff first.Get it [at Drupal.org](http://cvs.drupal.org/viewcvs/drupal/contributions/tricks/Quanta/)
