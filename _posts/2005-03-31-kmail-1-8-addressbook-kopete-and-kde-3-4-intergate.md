And how nice they integrate!My contactlist in kopete, for jabber, msn, irc, icq, aim and what more now integrate very nicely into my addressbook. I can insert pictures in that addressbook by hand, or have them automatically found from the users weblog or feed!And whats more: all of them support images. So I now can look at who's who.

I will see the picture of the person in the email. The senders online status shows up in my emails.<div class="image"> [![Pictures in kopete](/img_assist/gen/255&thumb=1)](/node/255)  <div class="caption">Kopete will now use pictures from your addressbook.</div></div>And last but not least (nothing to do with contacts: a spam meter shows up). All in all a nice set of features, that show the power of KDE: integration.
