Good news. My servermanager and [Drupal host](http://www.sense-hosting.nl), just announced they are moving their infrastructure to PHP5. Entirely. [PHP5 is really important if you want a future-proof hoster](http://gophp5.org/).

If you are looking for a Dutch host for your Drupal sites, I can advice you either one of the [cheaper Vhosts](http://www.sense-hosting.com), or, in case you decide to go for more Drupal sites, to [mail](mailto:sales@sense-hosting.nl) for a reseller of colocation contract. I have partnered up with them and give advice about Drupal hosting. Right now we are investigating SVN clients, so that you can manage your Drupal security updates and development really simple.
