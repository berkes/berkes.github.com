It looks like MSN prefers non-content<!--break-->[James Walkah](http://walkah.net/node/140) brought me to the idea of doin the ego-msning vs ego-googling test. While i fill up the complete #1 and #2 page on [google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22B%C3%A8r+Kessels%22&btnG=Search&meta=),  I got very suprised by [MSNs](http://search. msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22B%C3%A8r+Kessels%22&FORM=QBRE) #1 result. That was [a site](http://ber.buzzword.com/) I once set up to "see how other (then [drupal](http://www.drupal.org)) weblog systems do 'it'". As you can see, there is no blog post there, no content, only a title and subtitle, and it is over two years old! I completely forgot about it :)**update: i fill the complete #1 and #2 page on google for "BÃ¨r Kessels :) **
