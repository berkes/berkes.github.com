The list of flexinode issues has shrunk a lot. I closed about 30 per day, and think I have now got a list with bugs that actually exist, or need to be confirmed. A [dynamic up-to-date list is here](http://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=5737&versions=94848,94850&components=flexinode.module%20(core),flexinode_admin.module%20(Administration%20interface),flexinode_miniviews.module%20(Flexinode%20pages),User%20interface,Field%20type:%20file,Field%20type:%20image,Field%20type:%20select,Field%20type:%20textarea,Field%20type:%20textfield,Field%20type:%20timestamp,Update%20and%20installation%20script&categories=bug&states=1,16,8,13,14,15). By time of writing it were 25 bugs left for 'core fields' and flexinode itself.Once we've got them sorted out (I expect half of them don't need patches, but are simply related bugs, duplicate that are poorly described or errors on the side of the one reporting), we can release a __real__ 4.7 version. After that, its on to a 5.0 release. From there on the real work on a simplified, well architecured version can start. Woo.
