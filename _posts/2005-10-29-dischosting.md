For our Drupal hosting provisioning system, we chose to go for <a href="http://dischosting.sourceforge.net/">Disk Hosting</a>. This is an open source package, based around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a>, which is very powerful, but above all the industry standard for storing clients information. 
The idea, is to make Disk hosting ready for drupal vhosting, so that it can become a standard in drupal-hosting. 
Our server manager, is also lead developer of Disk Hosting, which was another major reason for using this project. 

You can follow the progress of this hosting project <a href="/taxonomy/term/36">in the webschuur.com 'Drupal Hosting' category</a>.
