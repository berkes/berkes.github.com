Indeed this is asked several times. I have even marked two patches as 'wontfix' of people who were so nice as to port it for us! 

__Tagadelic is already ported to 5__, codewise, just try __HEAD__. It is not released, and It wont be released until we (that can include you) have tested it well under 5.0 stable. Which is impossible, since Drupal 5 itself is not released.

Sorry if I am too strict, but I prefer to keep quality up but being strict about releases. I believe that there is one thing worse then no release: a broken release. And since I don't yet run any production sites, I cannot really test the module! <!--break-->
